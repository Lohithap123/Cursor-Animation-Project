# Cursor-Animation-Project
Creating a cursor animation project involves designing a dynamic cursor effect that follows the mouse movements on a webpage. This can add an engaging, interactive element to a website, enhancing the user experience.
Set Up Your HTML Structure: Create a basic HTML file with a container for your content. You'll also need to include the necessary CSS and JavaScript files to style and animate the cursor.
Define the Cursor in CSS: Customize the appearance of the cursor using CSS. You can use CSS properties to make the cursor a circle, dot, or any other shape.

Create JavaScript for Cursor Movement: Use JavaScript to capture the mouse's position on the screen and move the custom cursor element accordingly. You can also add animations or effects (like trailing or growing) to the cursor.

Apply Animation Effects: Use CSS animations or JavaScript to create effects, such as:

Smooth Follow: Cursor smoothly follows the mouse.
Expanding Circle: The cursor expands when hovering over certain elements.
Trail Effect: A trail follows the cursor.
